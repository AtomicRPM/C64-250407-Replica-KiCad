# Interactive-BOM

[The interactive bom html page](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bwack/C64-250407-Replica-KiCad/main/interactive-bom/ibom.html) is useful for assembling the board and finding signal traces by using a web browser. Try it here. For a BOM for ordering parts see the BOM above.
