# The C64 250407 replica

A replica of the Commodore 64 250407 1983 mother board, and a replica of the schematics made using SprintLayout and KiCad.

The replica project was started by Michael K. (Der Alte Bastler) in 2019 to learn SprintLayout and the process of reverse engineering PCB. I finished it, importet it in KiCad, imported the KU motherboard schematics and modified it to match the 250407 Reb.B schematics.

The board has been prototyped, and tested by me and Langwell Cowan.

We are not the first to reverse engineer this board, but we are the first to share the design files online I think.

[The interactive bom html page](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bwack/C64-250407-Replica-KiCad/main/interactive-bom/ibom.html) is useful for assembling the board and finding signal traces by using a web browser. Try it here. For a BOM for ordering parts see the BOM above.
